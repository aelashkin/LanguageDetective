a really good job. at the beginning, he introduced himself as a senior fire officer with a huge experience in organisational issues. he had a very clear and loud voice (something i normally expect from a senior fire office - but unfortunately there are enough officers who can''t speak so clearly). he pointed out the main challenges for the fire-service in the next decades very clear and he also gave a lot of very good examples for each key point he mentioned. what i missed in his talk was the presentation of solutions or at least a basic approach for dealing with the problems. i know now, that most fire-service organisations have the same problems like my one. but i still don''t know any solution for my problems. so in summary the lecture was really good but didn''t helped me to solve my problems.","21":"hi andy, i want to go to san francisco for work a week, so i know trouble you again. there is my daily routine- uauslly i'm water my plants every morning, i'm feed my dogs and

acceptance you need to have high degrees in the highschool, qiyas test and qodrat test. it's normal to have a high degree in highschool but can't find a acceptance becouse of the q tests.  another
