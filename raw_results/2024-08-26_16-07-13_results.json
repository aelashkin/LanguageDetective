challenges for the fire-service in the next decades very clear and he also gave a lot of very good examples for each key point he mentioned. what i missed in his talk was the presentation of solutions or at least a basic approach for dealing with the problems. i know now, that most fire-service organisations have the same problems like my one. but i still don''t know any solution for my problems.

success, the author believes, is to figure out who they really are.  the advice given by the author is quite naive. he even uses the word \"easy\" to say how simple it is to find a way to be successful. it seems that the author is the only one who thinks that an adult person needs advice in order to know their own personality traits. the author does not consider that being happy with work is not only about being self-assured, but also about dealing with pressure issues. even if the author were writing to teenagers, he could have considered developing a better argument and giving more information on the corporative world instead of telling people to take online tests.","374":"first, make an area of about 8 meters x 3 meters where it will be our \"bowling alley\". can use ten

unnecessary spending. for example, you should wake up one hour early and prepare your breakfast, instead drinking coffee outside. cooking your own food is the best way to save your money and also is much more health. for lunch, you could bring something from home or if you have enough time you could go outside and find something health and cheap. definitively, you can not go out with your friends everyday, maybe you can meet them just once a week, because you will expend much more money than you have in your budget. furthermore, you might invite your friends to have dinner in your house. remember that good restaurants use to be expensive, so you have to avoid them. i hope that the advisses given can be useful for you.","716":"to pete, chicken,vegetables and water. to jon, chicken,

some plastic cups and preparing your 'coffee to go' at home? lunch - try to buy only a soup or a little salad while the rest you want to eat has been prepared at home? and after work the most
