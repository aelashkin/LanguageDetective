        "This notebook provides a comprehensive implementation of the **Native Language Identification (NLI) Project**, which explores the use of machine learning and artificial intelligence methods to classify the native language (L1) of English as a Second Language (ESL) speakers based on their English text. Utilizing the EF-Cambridge Open Language Database (EFCAMDAT), we trained and tested several neural network classifiers to detect L1 influences in ESL writings. The notebook includes all steps necessary for data processing and evaluation, ensuring that the results presented in the accompanying paper are fully reproducible."
